	<h2> About Me </h2> 
	

<p> 
	I am going on 30, I had a daughter 4 months ago, I love motorcycles and I am making a career change! I finished by Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice from University of Houston - Downtown. After working in the field I decided against it right away and quickly went towards building websites. I started using the Adobe suite to design and build with the help of Dreamweaver and company. Along with CMS theme editing and designing logos, I quickly decided that I need to get certifications and/or proper knowledge of what ever it is I may want to pursue. 

	After 2 years and a kid, my head is full of information about the IoT, and its cousins. From you tube tutorials, forms, and friends I quickly decided to pursue software development. Currently I am an Apple Technician for CSAT Solutions and a student at the Hosuton Coding Bootcamp - UT Austin.
